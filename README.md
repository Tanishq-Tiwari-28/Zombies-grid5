Flipkart Grid 5.0
We made an interface that can tell about the drug's efficacy and effectiveness.
We have used ML algorithms and different AI techniques along with synthetic data generation for this. 


We have tried to build regression and classification models for predicting the same 
In this project, we have learned how to use SMOTE for synthetic data generation, about the ensemble models, and about adjustments and projections that are needed to build the classification models.
